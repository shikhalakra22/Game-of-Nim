# Game-of-Nim


Some games are all about luck. Your winning chance depends on the roll of a die or the cards you've been dealt. But there are other games that are only about strategy: if you play cleverly, you're guaranteed to win. 
A great example of this is the ancient game of Nim.

I have made the game in such a manner that AI always wins(strategic moves the AI makes to win the game in every possible way).

#The rules of Nim
The traditional game of Nim is played with a number of coins arranged in heap. There are two players. When it's a player's move he or she can take any number of coins from a single heap. They have to take at least one coin, though, and they can't take coins from more than one heap. The Loser is the player who makes the last move.
